<p style="width:50%;" > A vintage car is, in the most general sense, an old automobile, and in the narrower senses of car enthusiasts and
collectors, it is a car from the period of 1919 to 1930. Such enthusiasts have categorization schemes for ages of cars
that enforce distinctions between antique cars, vintage cars, classic cars, and so on. The classification criteria vary,
but consensus within any country is often maintained by major car clubs, for example the Vintage Sports-Car Club (VSCC)
in the UK.</p>

<p style="width:50%;" >A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. Most definitions of cars say that they run
primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four tires, and mainly transport people rather than goods.
Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 is regarded as
the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely
available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American
car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company.</p>

<h2>Futuristic/Concept Car's.</h2>
<img src="./images/futuristic car.jpg" alt="Image of concept car">
<p style="width:50%;" > A concept car (also known as a concept vehicle, show vehicle or prototype) is a car made to showcase new styling and/or new technology. They are often shown at motor shows to gauge customer reaction to new and radical designs which may or may not be mass-produced. General Motors designer Harley Earl is generally credited with inventing the concept car, and did much to popularize it through its traveling Motorama shows of the 1950s. Concept cars never go into production directly.
